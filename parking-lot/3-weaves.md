20-foot Weave – Proceed the same as you did in the 30-foot Weave. Practice this at **15 mph**.


## Coaching Tips
* Keep head and eyes up and knees in.
* Weave by pressing on the handle- bars in the direction you want to go. (Press right handgrip to lean right; press left handgrip to lean left.)
* Maintain a steady speed.
* Do not brake while performing weave.

## Problems & Corrections

1. Swinging too wide away from the markers.
    > Keep eyes up, looking forward, decrease lean angle; press less on the handlebars.
2. Hitting markers.
    > Keep eyes up, looking forward, increase lean angle slightly; press more on the handlebars.
3. Too much handlebar movement.
    > Maintain a steady, stable speed. Don’t slow down or brake.
