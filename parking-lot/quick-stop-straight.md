# Quick Stop, Straight

## Directions

![](images/parking-7.svg)

Practicing this exercise will help you stop quickly when something suddenly appears in your path.
Approach marker one, shifting up to second gear. As your front tire passes marker one, roll off the throttle, squeeze in the clutch lever, downshift to first gear and gradually apply both brakes to begin braking. Try to stop before marker two. Practice this at 10 mph, then 15 mph, then 20 mph. Do not exceed 20 mph.

## Coaching Tips

*  Keep your head and eyes up and looking forward.
*  When stopping, roll off the throttle, squeeze in the clutch, downshift to first gear and apply both brakes smoothly, gradually applying more pressure.
*  Do not release the clutch.
*  Keep the handlebars squared and the front wheel straight.
*  Do not release the rear brake until fully stopped.
*  Try to stop before the second marker.
*  When stopped, the left foot should touch the ground first; your right foot should be applying the rear brake. You should be in first gear, ready for a quick escape if needed
*  Try to stop before the second marker.

## Problem Corrections

1. Overshooting the final marker. Gradually apply more pressure to brakes. Avoid locking the brakes. If you lock the front brake, release and reapply.
2. Motorcycle slides sideways. Sit straight on seat and do not turn handlebars, look straight ahead. It is okay to lock the rear wheel if the motorcycle is going straight.
3. Engine over revs when using the front brake. Keep and wrist in a flat position when you grip the throttle. This will aid the throttle to brake lever transition and reduce inadvertent throttle roll-on. Close the throttle before braking. Avoid pulling back on the throttle when applying pressure to the front brake. Squeeze the front brake with four fingers.
