Start at “Begin Turning” markers with the motorcycle straight. Turn the han- dlebars, lean the motorcycle slightly in the direction you are turning, and turn your head to look through the intended path of travel. Use controlled clutch release and throttle as you make the sharp turn.

Finish your turn as close to line “A” as you can without touching it.

## Coaching Tips

* Keep head and eyes up; look through the turn so you can judge its sharpness and length.
* Turn the handlebars and lean the motorcycle in the direction of the turn.
* Use smooth clutch release and throttle as you exit.

## Problems & Corrections

1. Turning too short or too long.
    > Keep head and eyes up and look through the turn.
2. Motorcycle stalls or begins to fall into the turn.
    > Concentrate on maintaining steady speed or slight acceleration and smooth clutch release. Look through the turn.
