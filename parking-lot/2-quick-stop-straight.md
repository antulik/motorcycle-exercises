# Quick Stop in a Straight Line

Practicing this exercise will help you stop quickly when something suddenly appears in your path.

## Directions

Approach marker 1, upshifting to second gear. As your front tire passes marker 1, downshift and begin braking. Try to stop before marker 2. Practice this at **10 mph**, then **15 mph**, then **20 mph**. **Do not exceed 20 mph**.


## Coaching Tips

* Keep head and eyes up.
* When stopping, apply both brakes and squeeze the clutch, downshifting to first gear. Keep the clutch squeezed in.
* Keep handlebars straight. Squeeze front brake – don’t grab.
* Do not release brakes until fully stopped.
* When stopped, the left foot should touch the ground first.


## Problems & Corrections

1. Overshooting the final marker.
    > Gradually apply more pressure to brakes. Avoid locking the brakes. If you lock the **front** brake, release and reapply.
2. Motorcycle slides sideways.
    > Sit straight on seat and **do not turn handlebars**, look straight ahead. It is okay to lock the **rear** wheel if the motorcycle is going **straight**.
3. Engine over revs when using the front brake.
    > Keep and wrist in a flat position when you grip the throttle. This will aid the throttle to brake lever transition and reduce inadvertent throttle roll-on. Close the throttle before braking. Avoid pulling back on the throttle when applying pressure to the front brake. Squeeze the front brake with four fingers.
