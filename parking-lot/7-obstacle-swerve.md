With about 100' lead-in, approach the first pair of markers. As you reach the markers you should be going **15-25 km/h**. As your front tire passes the first pair of markers, make a swerve (right or left) avoiding the imaginary barrier or obstacle. Make sure youâ€™ve decided on which direction you intend to go before starting the exercise. Do not stop or apply brakes while performing the swerve.


## Coaching Tips
* To swerve right, press right until you have cleared the markers, then press left to resume straight ahead.
* Keep head and eyes up and knees in.
* Press on the handlebar in the direction you want to go.
* (Press right handgrip to go right; press left handgrip to go left.)
* **Do not brake and swerve at the same time.**


## Problems & Corrections
1. Unable to properly complete the swerve.
    > Keep a steady speed. **Maintain pressure** on the handlebar until you have cleared the marker, then press on opposite handgrip to straighten into the new path.
