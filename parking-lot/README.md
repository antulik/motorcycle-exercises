# Parking Lot Practice Guide

This booklet describes several exercises which you can practice by yourself or with a friend. The exercises will help you develop the skills you need to pass the motorcycle skill test and receive your license.* The proper execution of these exercises will also help prepare you for various traffic situations. Do not attempt these exercises unless you can already perform basic skills such as using the clutch and throttle correctly, shifting, and riding in a straight line. If you do not have these basic skills, be sure to seek instruction before practicing the skills in this guide. Of course, the best place to learn to ride is in a quality rider education program.

## Choosing a Practice Area
A well-marked parking lot is the best practice area. Be aware, however, of oil left by parked cars. Look for parking lots that are not used all the time at shopping centers, schools, churches or community centers. For instance, you might use a school lot in the evening hours, or a shopping center early in the morning.

Once you’ve selected a suitable location, it’s important to gain permission from the owner.

Keep this basic parking lot diagram in mind when setting up the exercises.

If the parking lot you choose doesn’t have lines, use the dimensions diagrammed here. Mark them using a tape measure and chalk.

Traffic is your greatest concern. Make sure you check to the front, sides and rear before doing an exercise. Also, make sure you watch out for children and animals and be considerate of others in the area.


## Safety Rules

The practice exercises are not dangerous. However, a few safety precautions should be followed:

* Wear proper protective clothing that includes: helmet, eye protection, gloves, boots or shoes that cover the ankles, long pants, and long-sleeved shirt or jacket.
* Inspect the motorcycle for defects before you start. If you are not familiar with the inspection procedures for your motorcycle, check the owner’s manual.
* Check the practice area for loose gravel, glass, oil left by parked cars, or other things that could be a problem.
* If possible, take a friend along to:
  * A. Watch out for traffic.
  * B. Help you if anything goes wrong.

## What to Bring

Bring 6 small objects that you can use as markers. Milk cartons or plastic bottles with a little water or sand in the bottom work well. Do not leave them at the practice area when you leave. If you cannot find any small objects, bring some chalk to draw markers on the pavement.
