# Parking Lot Practice Guide

The following series of pages describe several exercises which you can practice by yourself or with a friend. The proper execution of these exercises will help you in various traffic situations. Do not attempt these exercises unless you can already perform basic skills such as using the clutch and throttle correctly, shifting and riding in a straight line. If you do not have these basic skills, be sure to seek instruction before practicing the skills in this guide. Of course, the best place to learn to ride is in a quality rider education program, if one is located near you. Read the entire guide before you practice. Take the guide with you for reference when you practice. Keep practicing until you can do each exercise at least five times without a problem. Do not practice for more than one or two hours at a time. When you get tired, you cannot practice effectively.

## Choosing a Practice Area
A well-marked parking lot is the best practice area. Be aware of grease and fluid spills left by parked
cars. Look for parking lots that are not used all the time at shopping centers, schools, churches or community centers. For instance, you might use a school lot in the evening hours, or a shopping center early in the morning.


Once you've selected a suitable location, it's important to gain permission from the owner.
Keep this basic parking lot diagram in mind when setting up drills and exercises.
If the parking lot you choose doesn't have lines, use the dimensions diagrammed here. Mark them using a tape measure and chalk.


Traffic is your greatest concern. Make sure you check to the front sides and rear before doing an
exercise. Also, make sure you watch out for children and animals and be considerate of others in the area.

## Safety Rules

The practice exercises are not dangerous. However, a few safety rules should be followed:
*  Wear proper protective clothing to include: helmet, gloves, boots or shoes that cover the ankles, long pants, and long-sleeved shirt or jacket.
*  Inspect the motorcycle for defects before you start. If you are not familiar with the inspection procedures for your motorcycle, check the owner's manual.
*  Check the practice area for loose gravel, glass, grease and fluids left by cars, or other things that could cause a spill.
*  If possible, take a friend along to: (a) Watch out for traffic (b) Help you if anything goes wrong.

## What to Bring

Bring five small objects that you can use as markers. Tennis Balls cut in half, milk cartons or plastic bottles with a little sand or water in the bottom work well. If you use small objects, bring some chalk to draw markers on the pavement.
