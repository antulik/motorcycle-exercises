Practicing this exercise will help you stop smoothly,
such as for stoplights and stop signs.

## Directions

![](../images/parking-1.svg)

Accelerate straight ahead across the parking lot between **25-30 km/h** (shift to second gear). Begin to slow down and downshift at the first marker. Try to come to a smooth non-skidding stop with your front tire next to the last marker.

## Coaching Tips

* Keep head and eyes up.
* Keep the motorcycle on a straight course.
* Gradually apply both brakes and squeeze the clutch, downshifting to first gear at the same time. Keep the clutch squeezed in.
* Do not release the front and rear brakes until you come to a complete stop.
* When stopped, the left foot should come to the ground first.

## Problems & Corrections
1. Rear wheel skids.
    > Apply less pressure on the rear brake.
2. Overshooting marker.
    > Begin slowing and braking sooner.
3. Unstable during stop.
    > Keep head and eyes up during stop. Delay braking until necessary.
