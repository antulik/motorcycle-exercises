# Higher Speed Turns

## Directions

![](images/parking-1.svg)

Start, facing marker one at a distance sufficient enough to increase your speed to 10-15 mph. Just before reaching the end of line "A", reduce speed by applying both brakes. Start at point 1. As you start your turn at point 1, look to the exit point and gradually roll on the throttle throughout the turn. Practice turning in both directions.


## Coaching Tips
*  Avoid looking down.
*  Do not squeeze the clutch lever.
*  Avoid applying the brakes when the motorcycle is leaned over.
*  Look through the turn where to your exit where you want to go.
*  Beginning speed of 10-15 mph. Lean with the motorcycle.
*  Slow down before the turn by applying both brakes smoothly.
*  Gradually increase speed throughout the turn.

## Problem Corrections

1. Swinging wide of the turn. Look to the exit point and push more on the inside handlebar.
2. Cutting corner too close or turning too sharply. Do not look down. Look at the exit point. Gently roll on the throttle to stabilize the suspension.
3. Exiting wide out of the turn, making the oval into a circle. Slow down more before entering the turn, look to the exit point, push more on the inside handlebar and gently roll on the throttle.
