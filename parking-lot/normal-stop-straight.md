### Normal Stop, Straight

## Directions

![](images/parking-6.svg)

Practicing this exercise will help you stop smoothly, such as for stoplights and stop signs.
Accelerate straight ahead across the parking lot between 15-20 mph (shift to second gear.) Begin to slow down and downshift at the first marker. Try to come to a smooth non-skidding stop with your front tire next to the last marker.


## Coaching Tips
*  Keep head and eyes up.
*  Keep the motorcycle on a straight course.
*  Begin downshifting and braking at the first marker.
*  When stopping, roll off the throttle, squeeze in the clutch, downshift to first gear and apply both brakes smoothly, gradually applying more pressure.
*  Do not release the back brake until you come to a complete stop.
*  When stopped, the left foot should touch the ground first; your right foot should be applying the rear brake. You should be in first gear, ready for a quick escape if needed.

## Problem Corrections
1. Rear wheel skids. Apply less pressure on the rear brake.
2. Overshooting marker. Begin slowing and braking sooner.
